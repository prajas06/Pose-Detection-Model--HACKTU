About the Model

This repository contains the machine learning component of MediPal, a pose-based exercise tracking solution that performs real-time pose estimation, repetition counting, and form evaluation using computer vision. The system is built using MediaPipe for landmark detection and OpenCV for video processing, enabling rehabilitation monitoring and guided exercise sessions with performance insights.

To explore the complete end-to-end implementation of MediPal, including the frontend application and live deployment, refer to the links below.
